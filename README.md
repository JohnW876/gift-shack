## **UX**

The user types can be defined as but not restricted to the following:

* Shoppers tending towards the broad design led category.
* Shoppers more specifically interested in illustration, art and pattern design products.
* Shoppers looking for gifts in general.
* Shoppers looking for specific categories of products sold in the store. (Mugs, cushions, greetings cards, stationery etc) 
* Buyers representing resellers and marketplaces such as Wayfair, Amazon and other online retailers stocking design led products. 
* Buyers representing independent retailers such as high street gift shops and department stores both on and offline. 


The site has been primarily designed to meet the needs of these user types.
Clear sections which relate specifically to all of the user stories below are built into the website's design.
A mobile first approach was taken to create this project with consideration of ease of use and intuitive navigation to each of the features/sections.

Further information and screenshots showing how this project meets the user's needs can be
found in the separate [TESTING.md](https://github.com/JohnW876/blob/master/TESTING.md) file.

### **Data design**

When designing the database for the app I stuck closely to the needs represented in the user stories.






### **Wireframe mockups:**
Below is a link to the project's wireframe mockups which were created using Balsamiq Wireframes software prior to development to help with visualisation of features and layout. 

https://github.com/JohnW876//tree/master/wireframes
 
Wireframe mockups were created for every page of the website at mobile, tablet and desktop sizes and I referred to them throughout development. 


### **User Expectations:**
* What will they expect to see? - Users will expect to see an intuitive app with accessible features and a well designed user interface. 
* Does the site look credible and trustworthy? - Many elements will contribute to the first impression of a trustworthy site. These include, clear and intuitive navigation, good design and functionality. 
* Does the site offer what the user wants? - The features will need to meet the user's goals whilst delivering expected functionality and a valuable user experience.
* Does the site seem valuable enough for users to stay and return? - The features, functionality, usability and design will need to meet or exceed expectations to provide the value needed to ensure continued usage.  
  

### **Market Research:**
* Online research shows a number of apps to help writers work on their technique and improve their writing skills.
* There are also a good number of apps that deliver work by famous poets in either spoken word or purely textual formats.
* However there are very few that allow any user, regardless of skill level, to contribute their own work to a community and to create their own collection and/or manage a store of their work. 
* This app aims to fill that gap in the market and be available to all poets as an accessible and useful tool to help develop their body of work.


### **Visual Design:**
* Colour scheme -
  When designing the site I wanted to convey themes relevant to poetry such as passion and human emotions. In colour psychology these themes closely align to red which suggests passion, danger, life and love. 
  Red is used consistently throughout the site in the key elements such as the brand logo, page headings, edit form buttons, form icons, nav mobile dropdown and the social footer background. 
  With red as such a dominant colour it would not help to introduce another strong colour but does balance in a classic scheme with black, white and grey and is suggestive of paper and ink colours and poetry writing.

* Imagery - I also wanted to think of the design from a poet's point of view giving an analogue writer's feel to the homepage with background images of paper textures. 
* This was also the reason I chose to use Materialize CSS to help build the site as I felt the Material Design ethos offered simplicity whilst being inspired by paper and ink and was appropriate for poetry.
* Typography - For the main body of the site including headings and navigation, the chosen font is Open Sans for clarity and legibility. I did consider a script type in reference to handwriting but wanted to keep the site looking modern and accessible and thought a script would look too old fashioned and stuffy!
* For the poem text I used 'pre' tags in html which helps with the problem of how to display poems with appropriate line breaks. The Courier font used with the poems allows the text to stand out and is more easy to read from a user's perspective. 
* The brand logo uses Averia Serif Libre font which is intended to be a warm and friendly rather than too stiff and formal.

### **Acknowledgements**
As an artist and illustrator I wanted to design and build a website that I could actually use to help promote and sell the products that I create.
It's been fun and a great challenge to produce an app that has real world value and will be used to hopefully generate sales in the future.
I'd like to thank my mentor Aaron Sinnott, once again, for helping with positive and constructive feedback during the project and throughout the course!
